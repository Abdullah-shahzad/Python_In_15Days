# Python_In_15Days
15-day journey through Python programming: From introductory concepts to advanced OOP and algorithms, with practical exercises and examples.

**Week 1: Python Foundations, Data Structures, and Algorithms**

**-Day 1: Introduction to Python and Control Structures**
 - Install Python: Set up your development environment using VS Code or PyCharm.
 - Basic Syntax: Explore Python's syntax, including variables and data types.
 - Conditional Statements: Use if, else, and elif for decision-making.
 - Loops: Implement iteration with for and while loops.
**-Day 2: Functions**
 - Define and Invoke Functions: Learn to create and call functions, understand arguments and return values.
 - Built-in Modules: Explore Pythonâ€™s standard library modules like math, datetime, os, and json.
 - Custom Modules: Create and use your own modules.
**-Day 3: Data Structures and String Manipulation**
 - Lists and Tuples: Manipulate and sort lists and tuples, utilize list comprehension.
 - Dictionaries and Sets: Work with dictionaries for key-value pairs and perform set operations.
 - String Operations: Handle string slicing, formatting, and various operations.
**-Day 4: Basic Algorithms**
 - Sorting Algorithms: Implement and understand basic sorting algorithms.
 - Searching Algorithms: Learn about fundamental searching techniques.
**-Day 5: Practical Application**
 - Exercise 1: Develop a basic calculator to perform arithmetic operations.
 - Exercise 2: Write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year.
 - Exercise 3: Merge two lists, remove duplicates, and sort the result.
 - Exercise 4: Create a function to count the frequency of each character in a string.

**Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Advanced Python Concepts**

**Day 1: Classes, Objects, and Inheritance**
 - Define Classes: Create classes and instantiate objects.
 - Implement Methods: Understand and implement different types of methods (instance, class, static).
 - Inheritance: Learn about inheritance, including method overriding and multiple inheritance.
**Day 2: Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction**
 - Polymorphism: Apply polymorphism in practical scenarios.
 - Encapsulation: Implement encapsulation to protect data within classes.
 - Abstraction: Use abstract classes to define templates for derived classes.
**Day 3: Exception Handling and File Handling**
 - Error Handling: Implement error handling using try, except, and finally.
 - Custom Exceptions: Create and raise custom exceptions.
 - File Handling: Read from and write to files, including handling CSV and JSON files.
**Day 4: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators**
 - Iterators: Create and use iterators for traversing data.
 - Generators: Implement generators for efficient data handling.
 - Decorators: Understand and apply function decorators to enhance code functionality.
**Day 5: Practical Application**
 - Exercise 1: Design a BankAccount class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.
 - Exercise 2: Develop a vehicle hierarchy using inheritance (e.g., Car, Truck).
 - Exercise 3: Write a program to read and process data from a CSV file.
 - Exercise 4: Create a decorator to log the execution time of functions.
